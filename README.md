# Create your Community Clich√© Comment

Randomly generates comments based on linguistic patterns, observed to be used repetitively in social media photo posts.

I've separated these patterns into 7 different categories, in which it may or may not be added an interjection, and exclamation mark(s), generating the final comment.
Every case has a weighted probability to be combined with each other. 

Of course the research and the analysis made is not scientific, as the project was made totally for fun.
